Integrated Beam Fillet 1
15deg yaw
VERY IMPORTANT DATA
Purpose: field testing of Integrated Beam design with forward facing angled beam. Identify if 15deg is better than 20deg at preventing stalk interactions. Also 
identify if interactions cause measured stiffness to de-correlate from DARLING value. 
Comment: we ran tests on each section with and then without interactions. The non-interactions (isloated) tests were done by people holding the neighboring 
stalks back to not interfere with the stalk being measured. Some sections did not have significant interactions even without people holding the neighbors back,
and they are considered (isloated) as well. 
Results: interactions cause significant stalk variation and de-correlation from DARLING value.
