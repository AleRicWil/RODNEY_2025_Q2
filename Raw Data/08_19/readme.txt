Integrated Beam Fillet 1
20deg yaw
10 tests each at various offset/predeflection values
Purpose: verify that stalk predeflection does not affect measured stiffness value. Also identifying 'push-forward' angle
Result: there was a slight trend upward, but the range well within the device's measuremnt uncertainty across the full range of reasonable predeflection.
No variation in 'push-forward' angle either.
