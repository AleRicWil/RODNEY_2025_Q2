Integrated Beam Printed Guide 1 (square edge)
20deg
very first field data collect of 2025
Purpose: get a sense of how the device performs in the field and how the data differs from ideal. What will be required to process field data if the automated
setup for lab data doesn't work?
Results: data was never processed for stiffness values, but it inspired a new interface for manually identifying stalk interactions in data. Also determined
a ground guide is needed for steering the AMIGA platform to keep parallel with row.
