Integrated Beam Fillet 1
tests 1-16
20deg yaw
Purpose: do multiple stalks on the guide affect the measurement?
Result: not in the lab, not with the current raw electronics noise

test 100
15deg yaw
verifying new 15deg yaw setup with calibration weights

tests 101-end
15deg yaw
first use of 15deg yaw in lab
Purpose: does offset/predeflection affect the 15deg yaw, does sensor height affect the measurement. Also identifying 'push-forward' angle.
Result: no difference. No variation in 'push-forward' angle with predeflection or height
